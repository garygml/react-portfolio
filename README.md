# react-portfolio

I am doing some learning on reactjs so this is how i practice using react. 

Install node.js
Install webpack globally if needed. 
   ```
   npm install -g webpack
   ```

Clone the project and do a npm install and do a run dev
   ```
   npm install 
   npm run dev
   ```

Open a browser and do localhost:3000.
